Example : [1,3,5,4] return [5,4] and [1,6,9] return [6,9].



Follow the three step method for designing the method

Develop the java code for the method

Create a test program to test the method thoroughly using the Integer wrapper class.

Submit the 2 jave files MyArrayList.jave and the .java file of the test program. NO Zip files!
